GRAPH_TYPE: D directed, U undirected

---Files format---
-LABELS_NAMES_FILE-
label_name_1; label_name_2; label_name_3; ...

-INITIAL_VLS_FILE-
VL1[0]; VL1[1]; VL2[2]; ...
VL2[0]; VL2[1]; VL2[2]; ...
0; 1    # adapter
1; 0    # non adapter
one VL per row
#

-EDGES_FILE-
node node {}
node node {}
node node {}

-ATTRIBUTES_FILE-
value_1
value_2
value_3

---Requirements---
Nodes: integers

The results directory is created if not exists.
The nodes must be integers.

If the network created from the edge list file does not contain all the nodes in the range [0, max_node_id] or [1, max_node_id] and the INITIAL_VLS_FILE contains also the VLs of the nodes missing in the range:
execute the script providing an additional command line argument 'X':
python Main_LPA.py PATH_TO_LABELS_NAMES_FILE PATH_TO_INITIAL_VLS_FILE PATH_TO_EDGES_FILE PATH_TO_ATTRIBUTES_FILE GRAPH_TYPE PATH_TO_RESULTS_DIRECTORY X
