# AGGREGATION FUNCTION
Not trusting the opposite gender. So if the neighbours has same gender as the current agent,
it's privileged and its weight is 1; otherwise, it's discriminated

privileged= 1,
discriminated= 0,
bias_attribute_label= "Gender",
bias_attributes= [self.LPNet.nodes[self.id]["Gender"]]
