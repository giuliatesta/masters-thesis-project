STATE CHANGING METHOD: 1 (aggregation function + 50% of gender bias)
INITIAL NUMBER OF ADAPTERS: 20% of agents with index DNA higher than AVERAGE
SAME WEIGHT for SELF opinion and NEIGHBOURS opinion in the aggregation function
SAME WEIGHT for NEIGHBOURS opinions
!!! GENDER BIAS: pro same gender 50%
NO AGE, EDUCATION biases
SIMILARITY THRESHOLD in the creation of edges in the network = 0.50 (UPPER LIMIT for one connected component)


N. INITIAL NODES: 1000
N. EDGES: 243727
N. NODES: 1000
Average index DNA: 0.5529066838441191
INITIAL ADAPTER/NON ADAPTER RATIO: 100/1000

# used in the aggregation function
Having 0.5 as weights for both of them, means in theory no bias at all.
SAME_GENDER_WEIGHT = 0.5
DIFFERENT_GENDER_WEIGHT = 0.5

N. RUNS: 30
N. ITERATIONS: 30

# It's actually almost the same as the base line (CORRECT)
